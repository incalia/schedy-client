Population based training
=========================

`Population Based Training <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09846.pdf>`_ (PBT) allows you
to train your models in a smarter way. It takes care of finding not only the
best set of hyperparameters, but it also able to find the best hyperparameters
schedule during training. For instance, having a fixed learning rate during
training is often suboptimal, so PBT helps you find out when and how you should
change your learning rate.
